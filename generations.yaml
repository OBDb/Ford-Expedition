generations:
  - name: "First Generation (UN93)"
    start_year: 1997
    end_year: 2002
    description: "The original Ford Expedition was introduced as a replacement for the Bronco, offering four doors and greater interior space. Known internally at Ford as the UN93, it was developed from 1993 to 1996 at a cost of US$1.3 billion. Built on the F-150 platform, it featured body-on-frame construction and a traditional SUV design. Available with either a 4.6L or 5.4L Triton V8 engine, it offered substantial towing capacity and passenger comfort. The interior provided seating for up to nine passengers across three rows with optional three-row seating and first-row captain's chair seating. The Expedition was positioned between the smaller Explorer and larger Excursion in Ford's SUV lineup, competing directly with the Chevrolet Tahoe. The 1999 model year received a facelift similar to the contemporary Ford F-150, featuring a new front grille, bumper with integrated fog lamps, and updated dashboard controls. Production ran from July 22, 1996 to March 2002."

  - name: "Second Generation (U222)"
    start_year: 2003
    end_year: 2006
    description: "The second-generation Expedition was developed under the U222 program code from 1996 to 2002 and launched in May 2002 for the 2003 model year. It maintained its F-150 underpinnings but featured more refined styling and improved interior quality. A major innovation was the introduction of a four-wheel independent long-travel suspension system—a first for a full-size SUV—which improved both ride quality and third-row space by reducing unsprung mass and allowing 9.4 inches of suspension travel. Power came from the 4.6L and 5.4L Triton V8 engines (2003-2004) and the 5.4L 3-valve Triton V8 (2005-2006). The Expedition received a hydroformed fully boxed frame providing 70 percent improvement in torsional stiffness and all-new steering, braking, and electronic systems. The interior was significantly upgraded with better materials and premium perforated leather seating surfaces. Production ran from March 2002 to July 2006."

  - name: "Third Generation (U324)"
    start_year: 2007
    end_year: 2014
    description: "The third-generation Expedition was developed under the U324 program code and launched in August 2006 for the 2007 model year. It featured updated styling and improved capabilities on the F-150 platform. The extended-length Expedition EL was introduced, adding 15 inches to the overall length for increased cargo capacity and largely replacing the Ford Excursion. Powered exclusively by the 5.4L Triton V8 initially (2007-2008), later models from 2009-2014 used the updated 5.4L V8 with E85 ethanol capability. The interior was further refined with better materials and technology features including SYNC infotainment and voice-activated controls. This generation maintained the Expedition's position in the full-size SUV market during the economic downturn and high fuel prices. In January 2009, production was relocated from Michigan Assembly Plant to Kentucky Truck Assembly in Louisville. Production ran from August 2, 2006 to July 2, 2017 for the U324 platform."

  - name: "Third Generation (U3242 Mid-Cycle Refresh)"
    start_year: 2015
    end_year: 2017
    description: "On February 18, 2014, Ford introduced a mid-cycle refresh of the Expedition (U324) for the 2015 model year, designated U3242. The refresh featured significant visual and powertrain changes while remaining on the same U324 platform. The exterior received an aggressive three-bar grille with armadillo-like stepped appearance, all-new thinner headlamps, and an all-new front bumper with oversized lower air intake and twin LED fog lamps. The most significant change was replacing the 5.4L Triton V8 entirely with the new 3.5L 24-valve DOHC Ti-VCT EcoBoost V6 engine featuring twin-turbochargers, direct injection, and producing 365 horsepower and 420 lb-ft of torque. This improved fuel economy significantly to 16 city/23 highway MPG for 2WD and 15 city/21 highway for 4WD. The interior received upgraded materials and a revised center stack derived from the 2013-2014 F-150, with the latest MyFord Touch 8-inch touchscreen infotainment system and push-button start with intelligent access. New features included optional four-wheel independent suspension with continuously controlled damping, blind-spot information system, and upgraded off-road electronics. Production ran from early 2014 to July 2017."

  - name: "Fourth Generation (U553)"
    start_year: 2018
    end_year: 2024
    description: "The fourth-generation Expedition featured a complete redesign with an aluminum-alloy body similar to the F-150, resulting in significant weight reduction. Launched September 25, 2017, it introduced a new U553 platform based on the Ford T3 architecture. Available in standard and long-wheelbase Max configurations, it offered seating for up to eight passengers with improved interior space. Powered exclusively by a 3.5L EcoBoost V6 producing up to 400 HP in higher trims, paired with a 10-speed 10R80 SelectShift automatic transmission. The interior represented a major advancement with higher quality materials and technology, including available SYNC 4 with a 15.5-inch vertical touchscreen in updated models. Features included active noise cancellation, panoramic sunroof, and advanced driver assistance technologies. A significant refresh for 2022 updated the exterior styling, interior technology, and added the off-road oriented Timberline and street-performance Stealth Performance packages. This generation combined the capability expected of a full-size SUV with modern technology, efficiency, and refinement. Production ran from September 25, 2017 to 2024."

    description: "The fifth-generation Expedition was revealed on October 3, 2024, and began production on January 6, 2025 on the Ford T3 platform as the U717. It represents the latest redesign with a reworked liftgate called the Ford Split Gate, where the top half opens like a standard liftgate while the lower half opens like a pickup truck tailgate supporting up to 500 pounds. Available in standard and long-wheelbase MAX configurations, it retains body-on-frame architecture with aluminum-alloy body construction. Powered by the 3.5L Twin-Turbo EcoBoost V6 (EcoBoost D35) producing increased output, paired with the 10-speed SelectShift automatic transmission. New trim levels include the Active as the entry-level model with the Tremor off-road variant replacing the discontinued Timberline, featuring 33-inch all-terrain tires, off-road auxiliary lighting, Raptor-inspired running boards, underbody protection, and specialized modes including Trail 1-Pedal, Rock Crawl Mode, and Trail Turn Assist. The interior features the Ford Digital Experience with a 24-inch panoramic display as instrument cluster and 13.2-inch central touchscreen, with WiFi hotspot, Alexa, Google Play, and Google Maps integration. The Flex Powered Console allows the center console to slide back nearly 8 inches for improved second-row access. The Expedition is capable of towing 7,000 pounds standard or 9,600 pounds with a weight-distributing hitch. This generation sets a new standard for full-size luxury SUVs."
